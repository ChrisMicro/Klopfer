1. download the arduino IDE: 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2. download the smt32 arduino framework from:
https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/archive/master.zip

(The link is available under the smt32duino wikipage: http://wiki.stm32duino.com)

3. copy the downloaded directory in the ~/documents/Arduino/hardware.
When the directory doesn't exist yet, just create it.

4. Now the arm compiler is still missing, you can get it with the following package.
open the Arduino IDE, go under File/Preferences, and insert under "Additional Boards Manager URLs" the following file:
https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json


5. under Tools/Board/Boards Manager install the "SMT32 Cores by ST-Microelectronics" package.
